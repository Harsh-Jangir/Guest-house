#  King Sukh Guest House Website

This is a fully responsive website developed for King Sukh Guest House, designed and built during my internship at Innobyte Services. The site was created using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, closely matching the original design and theme provided by the client.

##  Project Objective

The goal was to replicate the layout and design of the existing King Sukh Guest House website while making improvements in responsiveness, performance, and modern design practices — all without using frameworks.

##  Tech Stack

- HTML5 – for structure  
- CSS3 – for styling and layout  
- JavaScript – for interactivity (e.g., navigation toggle, form handling)  
- AOS (Animate on Scroll) – for scroll-based animations

##  Key Features

- ✅ Mobile-friendly & responsive layout  
- ✅ Scroll animations using AOS  
- ✅ Clean, semantic HTML  
- ✅ Structured sections: Hero, About, Rooms, Gallery, Contact  
- ✅ Custom navigation bar and footer  
- ✅ Contact form (UI only)
